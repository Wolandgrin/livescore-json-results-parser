# Junit maven project for JSON parsing

This is my small project which demonstrates how to execute JUnit Jupiter
tests using Maven.

Please note that this project uses the [Maven Wrapper](https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper).
Thus, to ensure that the correct version of Maven is used, invoke `mvnw` instead of `mvn`.

More details will come later... I hope )
